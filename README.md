# DjangoRealEstate
Django Real Estate

**Summary**

Integration of a real estate web application in django. As with most sites, the main idea applies here, when the user assigns a house or anything depending on the options given to him and undertaken by the broker, after contacting the user. Also, the user at his assignment can choose the brokers he wants to undertake or the broker can reject the request from the user. Users are divided into two categories, ordinary users and brokers.
